# Description

This purpose of this project was to show off what I learned throughout my various assignments and lessons in class while making the site my own with various personalization additions. There's uses of background images, audio embeds, video, figures, navbar, and much more. Majority of the personalization came from my addition of songs from my favorite artist as well as the album covers for said tracks. I had an incredibly fun time playing around with this project

# Color Scheme

For my color scheme I changed it from my original swatch to a few various different ones. My main swatch for the site's background is a gradient pulled from one of my favorite albums and that goes for my hobbies and even my BOB. I pulled the background gradient from NS +(ULTRA), the BOB gradient I pulled from a picture from destroy lonely's tumblr, and then the hobbies colors I pulled from an alternate cover for LOVE LASTS FOREVER

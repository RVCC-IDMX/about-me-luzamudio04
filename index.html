            <h2>An Excerpt From Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.</p>
                
                <p>The morning of 16 May broke bright and cheerful. The sun shone warm and brilliant, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees. The very air seemed full of hope and happiness. I felt that the cloud of gloom which had been hanging over us for so long was lifting, and that we were about to enter upon a new phase of our strange and terrible experience.</p>
                
                <p>We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.</p>

            <h2>Biography:</h2>

            <div>

                <p1>I want to be...</p1>

                <p>A White hat hacker for the government. At first when starting off in RVCC I just chose cybersecurity because it had to do with technology and I was interested in it. 
                    Then sometime in spring of last year I found this youtuber who explained what he did in his position in cybersecurity and I realized how cool it was and where it could take me so I became very passionate. It was also due to my fascination with how unreleased songs are obtained and how they get released to the public. I thought it was really cool but obivously I wanted a legal form of doing that so hacking for the government became my long term goal. Being able to hack and be defensive against cyber attacks is something I find very appealing.</p>

                <figcaption>My Favorite Artist is Destroy Lonely <br> The reason he's my favorite artist is because of his sheer ability to be versatile. 
                    He doesn't stick to one sound and he has so many songs with such different beats and he's able to flow flawlessly on them all. Despite his official releases not being perfect due to song selection, his unreleased catalog proves that he is actually really capable of making insane songs.  </figcaption>

                <p>Information systems and technology. I chose this major because I've always had a fascination with technology mainly through gaming on various platforms.
                    I originally wanted to be a game designer but as I grew older I was more in tune with other aspects of technology

            <h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>

            <div>

                <p>Image hover effects are one of the many ways one can add a bit more flair to boring standard images in there html programs. As the MDN reference states "The hover CSS media feature can be used to test whether the user's primary input mechanism can hover over elements" and w3schools.com notes that "The CSS :hover pseudo-class is used to select elements when you mouse over them" and can be actually used on all elements and not just on links. As an example the image hover effect is used on the picture of Destroy Lonely I added on my page for the favorite artist section of my bio. As you can see when you hover over the image it scales up slightly to draw attention to it. It may not be much but it adds a nice touch to the page.</p>
                
                <p>Now this simple effect is only one of the many cool things you can do with this type of styling. Prismic.io has so many cool examples of what you can do such as when you hover over an image theres a glow in the background or having an image become a 3D rotatable object or even changing what your cursor looks like. I was actually able to implement the glow effect to the cover arts of the tracks I have embedded in the songs section up above. I think it gives the site a very nice touch of style no pun intended. These effects can be used to enhance the user experience by not only making it look visually appealing but also allowing the user to feel the website giving feedback from specific inputs they do. Now while these effects and features seem really cool to implement and have, they must not be overused because it could cause the website to be overdesigned. You may end up distracting any potential users with cool effects while you want them to actually take in the content of the page.</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately, not all browsers support these advanced hover effects, and some users may prefer to disable them for accessibility reasons. Mobile cannot truly support hover effects which is why in the MDN reference there is a hover media feature that can be used to test whether the user's primary input mechanism can hover over elements which is basically having the code ask "Does the primary input mechanism allow the user to hover over elements?" as stated in the MDN reference. Accessibility is a major factor in all things, if one is going to add these effects to their site, they must make sure that it is not preventing the user from accessing any sort of important feature or information that is integral to the website and its purpose. Experimenting with hover effects was extremely fun to do especially on a website of my own, it allowed me to take things from what I already thought was really good and make it even better by giving it that extra spark and I am very proud.</p>
